# aws-lambda

AWS Lambda
Run code without thinking about servers or clusters

Run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.

Automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.

Save costs by paying only for the compute time you use—by per-millisecond—instead of provisioning infrastructure upfront for peak capacity.
